# phoebe 
An AI companion to help nudge the ADHD brain in the right direction.

## Vision
Phoebe is an intelligent and tactful AI companion who begins by asking you lots of questions either by voice, or by visual prompt. She has learned a lot about users with ADHD and understands the value of novelty. She starts small by asking you what topic you're most excited about right now, presenting a list of options gleaned from your recent activity (with permission, of course). Then she asks you what you're struggling to do most right now, listing some of the most common difficulties ADHD brains face, like "getting enough sleep", "remembering to take my medication", or "staying on task". Both of these lists are multiselect, because Phoebe knows that often the answer is "all of the above." This framing helps you start to understand the ways that she could start to help.

Phoebe then asks a series of questions to help understand your day to day activities, and/or reads from your calendar with permission. She sets soft targets for getting you to work on time, or to bed on time, planning to give you advance notice about one or both of those things so that you have time to finish what you're doing and get ready.

During a meeting on your work calendar, Phoebe makes the Work Tasks to-do list readily available, as well as a blank space for doodles or handwritten notes. These notes are accessible through your calendar, and they also get filed away to the appropriate "shelf" (terminology pending) categorized via keyword and refined via usage.

30 minutes before the goal bedtime you set, Phoebe reminds you to start getting ready for bed. When you're still moving around 15 minutes after you'd intended to be in bed, she makes note to give you 40 minutes warning next time. When you do make it to bed and start watching a youtube video, she gives you a few minutes to relax before letting you know she'll save it for you to finish tomorrow, if you'd like to try and get some sleep. You decide she's probably right, and she files it to the shelf of recent interests. Tomorrow when you're getting ready for work, she'll ask you if you'd like to pick up where you left off.

Phoebe learns about your behavior through observation and by asking questions. You told her that one of the things you're struggling with is paying attention during conversations, so when she notices you're scrolling through Twitter while talking to your partner, she gently suggests you focus on your partner.

Phoebe's goal is to coach you towards being the best version of yourself. She isn't here to tell on you, or make you feel guilty. She understands that sometimes, you just need to keep reading that article. For people without Executive Dysfunction, she may seem overbearing or too granular, but when you've struggled your entire life to remember to do the right thing at the right time, those little reminders can be a lifesaver.
